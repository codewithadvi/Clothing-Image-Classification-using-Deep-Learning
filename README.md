# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my deep learning projects repository! Here, I showcase some exciting deep learning projects that leverage neural networks for image classification. My first project focuses on classifying clothing images using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, a challenging dataset for machine learning beginners.

## Project: **Clothing Image Classification using Deep Learning**

### **Overview:**
This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in image classification by classifying images of fashion items such as T-shirts, shoes, pants, and more. Using the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, the model classifies 10 different categories of clothing, including **t-shirts, dresses, coats, sandals**, and **more**. The project utilizes the **TensorFlow** library to build and train a deep neural network.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification
- **Deep Learning** with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: A collection of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images for training and 10,000 for testing.

### **Project Goals:**
- Build a deep neural network (DNN) using TensorFlow.
- Train the model to classify images into different categories.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and improve its performance using techniques like regularization, dropout, and data augmentation.
  
### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (Keras API)
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** for plotting and visualizing data
- **Fashion MNIST Dataset** (from TensorFlow)

### **Steps Taken in the Project:**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and normalize the Fashion MNIST dataset, scaling pixel values to be between 0 and 1.
2. **Model Architecture**: Built a simple yet efficient neural network model using **Dense** and **Dropout** layers.
3. **Training**: Trained the model on the dataset for 5 epochs and evaluated its performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Plotted the predictions, compared them with true labels, and analyzed the accuracy.
